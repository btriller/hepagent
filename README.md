##### Architecture
```
bpf -> pnet -> packets mod 
               - pre-parse a packet
               - if it's one of the types we want, TCP/UDP etc, pass it to lua capture plan
               -> capplan.lua
                  - run parsing logic
                  - call into rust module callbacks when need to do certain actions
                      -> sip rust module: parse, check method, parse out session params
                      -> hep rust module: send prepared HEP packet
                         -> calls into the publish module via mpsc channel
                      -> json rust module: send prepared json payload
                         -> should call into the json publish mpsc channel too
```

##### Modules
Rust modules register using `register_module` functions passing in Scripting instance - which allows to register in Lua.

For dynamic module loading those could be compiled as dynamic libs and `register_module` exported as #[no_mangle] symbol, making it an entry point for each module registration.
